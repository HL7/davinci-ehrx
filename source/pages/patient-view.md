# Patient Story -  draft review 12/05/2018

## Objectives:
Shows a story about a care transition from Inpatient Setting to an Assisted Living Center. The story is based on a true story. It aims to be realistic. It includes dimensions that show the need and value for sharing clinical information not only between providers, but between payers and providers. It also shows how clinical information gathered for patient care also serves as evidence needed to support quality measurement and value-based care.

Focus will be on the HEDIS Transition of Care Measure  (TRC) https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/transitions-of-care/
