# Nothing that can be done about this
Target Code System http://snomed.info/sct is only supported on the terminology server, so the target codes are not validated for performance reasons

# This will be done in a future release
%Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now%

# The NUCC codes are all valid (according to tx.fhir.org), but the validator is colliding with UTG content as discussed here:

# This is a configuration issue with the terminology server
Target Code System http://snomed.info/sct doesn't have all content (content = not-present), so the target codes cannot be checked

# The patterns are only locking down the system, which is the discriminator for the slices, so this is fine.
