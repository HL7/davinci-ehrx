# These are termerminology server limitations
The concept map has too many codes to validate (1,123)
Target Code System http://snomed.info/sct is only supported on the terminology server, so the target codes are not validated for performance reasons

# There is no location in the IG where it makes sense to use this profile.  It's created for downstream IGs.  The definition is sufficiently simple that there's no possibility of errors in the construction.
