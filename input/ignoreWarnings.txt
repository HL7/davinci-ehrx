# 0.b This is a known issue on terminology.hl7.org and is being worked on by Terminology Infrastructure
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/provenance-participant-type|4.0.1

# 1. Consider adding this in the future.  To this point, we havn't said that HRex actually has use-cases - FHIR-48917
WARNING: DA VINCI: The second menu item under Background should have the label Use Cases.

# 2. Detailed changes weren't tracked until after 1.0.0 was released
WARNING: DA VINCI: The Change Log page (history.html) does not include any Jira tracker items links for the section with title STU 1.0.0
WARNING: DA VINCI: The Change Log page (history.html) does not include an h3 section for the version 0.2.0
WARNING: DA VINCI: The Change Log page (history.html) does not include an h3 section for the version 0.1.0

# 3. Da Vinci doesn't have any conformance expectations itself - conformance expectations are determined by IGs that derive from HRex
WARNING: DA VINCI: Da Vinci IGs SHOULD define CapabilityStatements.  Without CapabilityStatements, there is no technical way to declare conformance to the IG.

# 4. HRex can't depend on itself
WARNING: DA VINCI: This IG does not depend on HRex.  Either add a formal dependency or confirm that a textual dependency has been declared.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The Base Specs menu item must have a child called HRex 1.1.0.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The Conformance page (conformance.html) needs to include a link to the HRex conformance.html page.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The Conformance page (conformance.html) Must Support section needs to include a link to the HRex conformance.html#mustsupport section.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The Security page (security.html) must include a reference to the HRex security.html page (with a SHALL comply).

# 5. This isn't actually a resource in R4, so can't point to it
WARNING: DA VINCI: The How to Read page (fhir.html) needs to include a reference to the http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/subscriptiontopic.html because this IG uses the subscriptiontopic resource.

# 6. These are inherited from US Core
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/hrex-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[9].slicing.discriminator[0]: The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/hrex-provenance: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[22].slicing.discriminator[0]: The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# 7. This is an issue with the underlying R5 terminology and should be addressed via a system-wide update

# 9. These are termerminology server limitations
The concept map has too many codes to validate (662)
Target Code System http://snomed.info/sct is only supported on the terminology server, so the target codes are not validated for performance reasons

# 10. There is no location in the IG where it makes sense to use this profile.  It's created for downstream IGs.  The definition is sufficiently simple that there's no possibility of errors in the construction.
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-hrex/StructureDefinition/hrex-reference-id'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this data type profile

# 11. The terminology validation here is incorrect in R4, but these codes are both valid

# 12. This will be done in a future release
%Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now%

# 14. The patterns are only locking down the system, which is the discriminator for the slices, so this is fine.
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/hrex-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[10].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# 15. These identifiers are 'extra' and aren't expected to match any slice

# 17. These code systems should not be draft in THO.  The terminology work group is trying to fix these

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-hrex/StructureDefinition/hrex-patient-demographics').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Patient derive from the core US profile.

# 22. The IG description is talking about the potential for certain resources to be deprecated in the future.  The IG itself is definitely not deprecated
