The content formally found at this page is now hosted [here](http://build.fhir.org/exchanging.html) in the FHIR core specification (from FHIR R5 and on). While Da Vinci IGs remain based on FHIR R4, the guidance on selecting between alternative architectural approaches to data exchange holds irrespective of the version and the guidance now found in the core specification should be adhered to when designing Da Vinci implementation guides.

§ex-1^igauthor^business:All Da Vinci IGs that define [CapababilityStatements]({{site.data.fhir.path}}capabilitystatement.html) setting expectations for support for certain FHIR interactions, operations, or other exchange mechanisms **SHALL** include a 'design' section that explains the IG's choice of exchange architecture in terms of the decision tree found in the FHIR core specification.§
