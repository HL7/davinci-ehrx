This page provides a list of practices that **SHOULD** be followed by all Da Vinci IGs.  (Non-Da Vinci IGs are welcome to adhere to them as well.)  In the future, IG validation may automatically enforce a subset of these expectations.

1. When using the Reference data type, the IG SHOULD assert one or more profiles that describe the nature of the reference desired.  In most cases, one or both of [RESTful Reference](StructureDefinition-hrex-reference-rest.html) or [Identifier Reference](StructureDefinition-hrex-reference-rest.html) will be suitable, though an IG may choose to define its own profiles if there are more specific rules that apply.
