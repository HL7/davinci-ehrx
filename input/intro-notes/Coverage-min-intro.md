This example includes the minimum set of the mandatory elements from the [HRex Coverage](StructureDefinition-hrex-coverage.html) profile.

Notes:

* The payer is handled as an external reference.  It could point to a contained resource if the data is maintained as part of the Coverage instance or just have a 'display' element in situations where all that is known is the payer name.
