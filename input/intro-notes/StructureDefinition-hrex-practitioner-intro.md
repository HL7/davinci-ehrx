Da Vinci refines Practitioner in two ways:

* It requires support for Practitioner qualifications, though only as text.  (There's no consistent coding of qualifications in the payer space.)  Qualifications can be important for evaluating the elegibility of ordered or performed services for insurance coverage.
* It adds support for Medicare certification number as an alternate identifier type as not all payer and provider environments are able to use NPIs for all relevant providers.
