This alternate [HRex Task Data Request](StructureDefinition-hrex-task-data-request.html) profile example is similar to the [completed query](Task-query-complete.html) example.  However, in this case, the output is a reference to the documents.  (Two relevant documents mean two repetitions of the 'output'.)  In addition, this example does not include a `basedOn` element - as no authorization was needed.
