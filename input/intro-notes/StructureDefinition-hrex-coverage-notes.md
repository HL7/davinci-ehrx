If the member identifier (conveyed in `Coverage.identifier`) is known, it must be sent as this uniquely identifies a covered individual.  If not, then the `Coverage.subscriberId` can be used together with demographic information found by resolving `Coverage.beneficiary` to identify the member.  (There can be multiple members associated with a single subscriber - e.g. family members of an individual who is covered under a work-based policy.)

Additional notes and guidance around how to map real-world insurance card information into the Coverage resource can be found in the [CARIN Digital Insurance Card IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/insurance-card/Physical_Insurance_Card_Data_Elements.html).  §mm-2?^mmclient,mmserver^exchange:As a rule, all Coverage elements available **SHOULD** be populated, even if not all might be strictly necessary to identify the member because rules can vary from insurer to insurer about which pieces of information are necessary to uniquely identify a member.§
