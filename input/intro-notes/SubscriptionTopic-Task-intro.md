intro to inform reader of the Basic view -->
<div class="added-content" markdown="1">

This guide formally defines the HRex Subscription Topic as a [SubscriptionTopic](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/subscriptiontopic.html) resource defined in FHIR 4B and later versions. Be aware that this resource is not supported by FHIR R4 systems. Subscription Topics in R4 can be defined using a Basic profile resource with extensions.  The [raw xml](SubscriptionTopic-Task.xml) and the [raw json](SubscriptionTopic-Task.json) views for this SubscriptionTopic show the equivalent FHIR R4 Basic profile.

Note that supporting SubscriptionTopic nor the equivalent Basic resource versions described in the R5 Backport Implementation Guides is NOT required by this guide to support subscriptions.
