This profile is intended exclusively for use as part of the [$member-match](OperationDefinition-member-match.html) operation.  It conveys information necessary to help resolve a particular member in a target payer.  It diverges from US Core in that it does not point to the US Core patient profile.  US Core Patient requires that identifier be present.  However, when invoking $member-match, no patient identifier will be known.  (The whole point is to discover the Patient identifier.)
