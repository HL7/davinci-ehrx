This example includes all the mandatory and mustSupport elements from the [HRex Practitioner](StructureDefinition-hrex-practitioner.html) profile, including multiple repetitions of elements that are permitted to repeat.  This represents the set of elements that conformant systems must be capable of handling.

Notes:

* It would be unusual for *all* the mustSupport identifier types to be present, but it is possible.  And other identifiers might be present as well.
* Only the provider's family name must be supported - though other parts can certainly be present.
* Only text is shown for qualifications because that is all that must be supported.  However, if codes are known, they should be sent.
