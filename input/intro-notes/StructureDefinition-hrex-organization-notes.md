The Identifier.system here used for Tax Identification Number is not yet officially registered with HL7.  We have adopted the one used by QI-core and a number of implementers.  However, there is a possibility it will change.  Implementers should consider this potential for change and author their systems to accomodate a change if necessary.  (i.e. be prepared to match on more than one system value and potentially export multiple identifier repetitions, each with a different system, if it becomes necessary.)
