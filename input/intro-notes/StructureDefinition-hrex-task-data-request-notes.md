A single profile is defined, although what elements are appropriate will vary depending on the stage of the Task's life-cycle.  On initiation, the status would be 'requested' and there would not generally be a 'businessStatus' or 'statusReason' and certainly would not be any output.  As execution progresses, the Task.status would be adjusted to reflect acceptance or rejection - and statusReason would typically be populated in the latter case.  Once the Task gets underway, 'businessStatus' might be filled in to help indicate progress/expected timelines.  Finally, once the data becomes available, the status is changed to 'completed' and the outputs are linked.  (In some cases, preliminary outputs might be linked prior to the Task becoming 'completed', though that would be unusual in the Da Vinci situation.)
