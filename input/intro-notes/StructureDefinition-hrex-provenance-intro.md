Provenance is essential when sharing information in the payer space because any given record might have passed through multiple hands before it arrives at a payer.  Provenance provides traceability as to where the data originated and helps in the evaluation of the information as well as rationalizing duplicate data acquired through multiple sources.  Da Vinci makes a couple of improvements to the US Core Provenance profile that will hopefully be migrated into that profile in the future:

* Capturing the time of the creation/update, not just the time the Provenance instance was created
* Ensuring that the Provenance target in fact resolves to a specific resource reference, not allowing only display or an identifier

In addition, in Da Vinci, signatures on Provenances must be retained if present.
