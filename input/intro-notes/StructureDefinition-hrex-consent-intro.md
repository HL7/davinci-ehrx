Consent allows sharing the fact that a patient has authorized the sharing of data between two participants.  Sharing the existence of consent is often a pre-requisite to being able to share information.  This profile is intended only for use by the [$member-match](OperationDefinition-member-match.html) operation and is scoped to the types of consent relevant there (consent to share all information or only non-sensitive data).  However, it can potentially also be used by other Da Vinci implementation guides if those consent types are appropriate and sufficient.
