This is the final stage of the [HRex Task Data Request](StructureDefinition-hrex-task-data-request.html) (the next step after the (status example)[Task-query-status.html]).  The status changes to 'complete' and the output is filled in.  In this case, the output is contained within the Task because the requested searchset isn't going to be persisted in the source EHR for retrieval by others.  This will be most common for 'query' Tasks.  However, it is not *required* that the searchset Bundle be contained.  See the (document example)[Task-document-complete.html] for an example of a non-contained output.
